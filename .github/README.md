Arena is a demo server made with [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom), as both a showcase for what Minestom is 
capable of and as a way to teach developers how to work with Minestom.

The demo server is hosted at minestom.net, or you can follow below guide to get it up and running yourself.

# Install
Arena can be installed in multiple ways. You can use a pre-built version or clone and build it yourself.
We recommend cloning since this allows you to experiment with Minestom.

## Cloning
You can also choose to clone this repository with:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Minestom/Arena.git
```
And then build with:
```shell
./gradlew build
```
You will then find your jar in ./build/libs/ which you can run with:
```shell
java -jar arena-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```
Of course you can also use an IDE which makes this process easier.

## Pre-built
Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Minestom/Arena/releases/tag/latest)
and then run it with the following command:
```shell
java -jar arena-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```

# Goals
The reason behind making Arena was to help new developers get into Minestom and familiarize themselves with the toolchain.
Besides, it's a good showcase of what Minestom can do.
